# Image-processing-Blackhole
This repository contains image processing algorithms applied to the image of the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). These algorithms enhance the image quality, extract features, and provide valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of the black hole and its surrounding environment.
